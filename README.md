# express-gateway-plugin-hmac-request
This plugin for [Express Gateway](https://express-gateway.io) is used to set HMAC headers on a proxy request meaning a client making a request of the API gateway won't need to set any HMAC headers itself. *This plugin is NOT used to allow clients requesting the API gateway to authenticate using HMAC.*

```bash
